- Unset the $PATH and check if it is not working anymore
- Set the $PATH to a multiple directory value (directory1:directory2) and check that directories are checked in order from left to right
Simple Quotes
- Execute commands with simple quotes as argument
- Try empty arguments
- Try environment variables, whitespaces and semicolons in the simple quotes
Redirection
- Execute commands with redirections < and/or >
- Repeat multiple times with different commands and arguments and sometimes change > with >>
- Check if multiple of the same redirections fail
Pipes
- Execute commands with pipes like ‘cat file | grep bla | more’
- Repeat multiple times with different commands and arguments
- Try some failing commands like ‘ls filethatdoesntexist | grep bla | more’

- Try to execute a really really really long command with a ton of arguments
- Have fun with that beautiful minishell and enjoy it
Bonus
We will look at your bonuses if and only if your mandatory part is excellent. This means that you must complete the mandatory part, beginning to end, and your error management must be flawless, even in cases of twisted or bad usage.
